## Release Process

Releases are managed through GitHub Actions:

1. **Version Bumping**: Versions are automatically determined based on Git tags
2. **Package Publishing**: Packages are automatically published to NuGet.org
3. **Release Notes**: Changelog is automatically generated from commits

### Creating a Release

1. **Create a Git Tag**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Build and test the code
   - Create NuGet packages
   - Publish to NuGet.org
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Generate release notes

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature development
- `hotfix/*` - Critical bug fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

### Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for:

- **CI Pipeline**: Build, test, and validate on every PR
- **Code Quality**: SonarCloud analysis
- **Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Release**: Automated package publishing

## Documentation

### API Documentation

- Use XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
